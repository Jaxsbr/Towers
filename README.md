# Towers
I've always been facinated with tower defence games. This genre got me into programming and thus, I feel very strongly about getting a fun playable game out that everyone can enjoy.
My idea is to get the game 95% polished before doing any art or fancy effects, so dev art will have to do :(


## Run
```
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Game Plan

## Goal
- Create a fun tower defence with TypeScript
- Learning Webpack, build/bundle
- Host and deploy on Azure
- Open game to public, track scores


## Todo
- Refactor: Magic variables need a home
- Refactor: De-Couple dependencies, implement global access mechanism
- Performance optimization
- Menu and hosting page
