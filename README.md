# Towers
I've always been facinated with tower defence games. This genre got me into programming and thus, I feel very strongly about getting a fun playable game out that everyone can enjoy.


## Play

## Run

npm install
npm run-script build
npm run-script run
```

## Goal
- Create a fun tower defence with TypeScript
- Learning Webpack, build/bundle
- Host and deploy on AWS
- Open game to public, track scores
